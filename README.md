***The situation made worse from a moment to moment.
every single step took so much more energy and time then it was ment to.
nothing can be worse now, because a minute after it seems to work, eventually, it failed again.
and no ctrlz or earlier commit could help.***

Well I'm a little bit frustrated, yes. I suppose.

This is a coup game. not a real one, becouse you can't really implement a game of lies, but it based on it. the exact instruction are here: https://github.com/BenjaminSaldman/CPP_EX3_25?tab=readme-ov-file

so if you wanna see how this project doesn't work in this hour of night, you may download QT. then all you gotta do for see my (not at all) working GUI is type
make qt
in cmd. I swear it worked once for five minutes but I can't do it again.

Also you can try 
make main
which will run the demo that have been provided
or
make test
which would show you that my project went very well untill the GUI
and make valgrind
which run the demo with valgrind, successfully.
and... make clean that you can use for *clean* the unnecessary files.

there is also the simpleGame file, which has a demo of simple game - with no roles, that doesn't have make target but can be runned handly.
 and... that it. *may the force be with you.*
